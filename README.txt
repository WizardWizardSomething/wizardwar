Controls/How To Play
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-WASD to move
-Mouse to aim and shoot

Enemies will randomly spawn; get as many kills as you can. The
walls will slow you down, but not keep you from leaving; your
weapon has a range limit however, so you will need to be on
screen to get kills!
